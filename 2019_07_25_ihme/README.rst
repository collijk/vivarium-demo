Intro to Simulation with Vivarium and Vivarium Public Health
============================================================

This presentation gives an overview of the field of computational simulation and
a bit of background on the start of the Vivarium project.  It then gives an explanation
of individual-based, discrete-time, Monte Carlo simulation; the methodology used
for most Vivarium simulation projects. Finally, it talks about the models and 
implementations we've put together in Vivarium Public Health, our toolbox
for public health and intervention modeling.
